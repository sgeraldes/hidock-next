## Expected Coverage Improvement

These comprehensive tests specifically target the 286 lines mentioned in the coverage gaps. The test suite includes:

- **60+ individual test methods**
- **13 test classes** organized by functionality
- **Comprehensive mocking** of device communication
- **Error injection** for edge case testing
- **Progress callback validation**
- **Exception handling verification**

## Running the Tests

To run the comprehensive coverage tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_desktop_device_adapter_comprehensive.py -v
```

To verify coverage improvement:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_desktop_device_adapter.py tests/test_desktop_device_adapter_comprehensive.py --cov=desktop_device_adapter --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Test Reliability

All tests use proper mocking to:
- Avoid hardware dependencies
- Ensure consistent results
- Test error conditions safely
- Validate callback mechanisms
- Verify exception handling

The tests are designed to be:
- **Deterministic**: Same results every run
- **Isolated**: No test dependencies
- **Fast**: Mock-based, no real device communication
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all identified missing lines
- **Maintainable**: Clear test organization and documentation

This comprehensive test suite should successfully push the coverage of `desktop_device_adapter.py` from 75% to over 80% by targeting the specific uncovered lines with realistic error scenarios and edge cases that could occur in production device communication.
