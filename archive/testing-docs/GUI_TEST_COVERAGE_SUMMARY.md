# GUI Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive test coverage for all GUI files in the hidock-desktop-app to increase test coverage from 75% to above 80%.

   - Tests configuration management
   - Tests theme and color application
   - Tests panel toggling (transcription, visualizer)
   - Tests audio callbacks and dependency checking
   - Tests cached files display

## Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Comprehensive Mocking**: All external dependencies properly mocked
2. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Both isolated unit tests and workflow integration tests
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests for error conditions, empty data, None values
4. **Event Simulation**: Mouse clicks, keyboard events, drag operations
5. **State Management**: Tests for connected/disconnected states, UI updates
6. **Async Operations**: Tests for threaded operations with proper mocking

## Coverage Improvements

- Added ~2,400 lines of test code across 6 new test files
- Covers all major GUI components and their interactions
- Tests both happy paths and error scenarios
- Includes integration tests for complete workflows

## Test Execution

To run the GUI tests with coverage:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_gui_*.py --cov=gui_main_window,gui_treeview,gui_event_handlers,gui_actions_device,gui_actions_file,gui_auxiliary --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

This comprehensive test suite should push the overall test coverage well above the 80% target.
