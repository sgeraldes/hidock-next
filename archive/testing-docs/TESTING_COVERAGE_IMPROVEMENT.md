## Testing Strategy

### Mocking Approach
- **USB Backend**: Mocked to avoid hardware dependencies
- **Device Objects**: Comprehensive mocks with realistic behavior
- **Error Conditions**: Systematic testing of USB errors, timeouts, and protocol issues
- **State Management**: Proper setup and teardown of device states

### Error Coverage
- USB communication errors (timeouts, pipe errors, access denied)
- Protocol errors (malformed packets, unexpected responses)
- Connection state errors (device not found, interface issues)
- Data parsing errors (invalid formats, insufficient data)

### Edge Cases
- Buffer overflow and underflow conditions
- Sequence ID wrapping
- Empty responses and malformed data
- Kernel driver interactions on different platforms
- Health check recursion prevention

## Expected Coverage Improvement

### Before: 40% Coverage
