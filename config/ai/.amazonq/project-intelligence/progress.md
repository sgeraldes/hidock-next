### üêõ Known Issues
- **Audio Visualization**: Occasional "Error loading waveform" with complex audio files
- **Device Detection**: Rare cases where device requires manual refresh after connection

### ‚úÖ Recently Resolved Issues
- **Settings Not Saving**: Root cause was save_config() overwriting instead of merging - now fixed with comprehensive merge logic
- **Column Sorting Lost**: Settings were being overwritten by other saves - now all settings are preserved
- **Apply Button Not Working**: Was working but settings got overwritten later - now all settings persist correctly
- **Test Config Contamination**: Tests were corrupting real application config - now use isolated temporary files
