# üìÖ **Product Backlog: Calendar Integration Theme**

> **Vision:** Transform HiDock from a meeting recording device into a complete meeting intelligence platform through seamless calendar integration.

## üéØ **Theme Overview**

**Current State:** HiDock automatically records meetings but operates in isolation from calendar systems.  
**Future State:** Intelligent meeting management with calendar-aware recording, automated follow-ups, and actionable insights.

**Platform Strategy:**
- **üñ•Ô∏è Desktop (Python/CustomTkinter):** Core features first, limited by UI framework constraints
- **üåê Web (React/TypeScript):** Advanced features and workflows, modern UI capabilities
- **üîÑ Migration Path:** May require desktop UI framework change (Python ‚Üí Electron/Tauri) for full feature parity
