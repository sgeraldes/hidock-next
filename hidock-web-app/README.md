### ü§ñ AI-Powered Transcription

- **Gemini AI Integration**: High-quality audio transcription
- **Insight Extraction**: Automatic summary, key points, and action items
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Use your own API keys for privacy and control
- **Multiple Language Support**: Transcribe in various languages

### üåê Modern Web Experience

- **Progressive Web App**: Install like a native app
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates and progress tracking
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Customizable appearance

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser with WebUSB support (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- HiDock device (H1, H1E, or compatible) - _Optional for demo_
- Gemini API key (for transcription features) - _Optional for demo_

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd hidock-web-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables (Optional):**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local and add your Gemini API key for full functionality
   ```

3. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Demo Mode

The app includes mock data and works without a physical device or API key for demonstration purposes. You can:

- Browse the dashboard with sample recordings
- Test the audio player with mock files
- Try the transcription interface (requires API key)
- Explore all UI components and navigation

### Real Device Integration

The app now includes **complete WebUSB protocol implementation** based on the original Python application:

- **Actual HiDock device constants** (Vendor ID: 0x10D6, Product IDs: H1, H1E, P1)
- **Full protocol implementation** with packet building, command sending, and response parsing
- **All device operations**: list files, download recordings, delete files, format storage, sync time
- **Multi-device support**: Automatically detects H1, H1E, and P1 models
- **Robust error handling** with connection management and recovery

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Usage

### Connecting Your Device

1. Click "Connect Device" in the sidebar
2. Select your HiDock device from the browser prompt
3. Grant necessary permissions

### Managing Recordings

- View all recordings in the Recordings tab
- Download files locally for backup
- Play recordings directly in the browser
- Delete files from device storage

### AI Transcription

1. Upload audio files or use device recordings
2. Click "Transcribe" to convert speech to text
3. Extract insights including summaries and action items
4. Export transcriptions and insights

## Configuration

### Gemini API Setup

1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add the key to your `.env.local` file:

   ```shell
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Configure transcription settings in the Settings page

### Device Configuration

The app automatically detects HiDock devices. If you have connection issues:

1. Check that WebUSB is enabled in your browser
2. Ensure your device is in the correct mode
3. Try a different USB port or cable
