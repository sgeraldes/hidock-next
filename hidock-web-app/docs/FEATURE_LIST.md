  - **`Implementation Notes:`** Technical considerations, dependencies, or architectural changes needed.
  - **`Acceptance Criteria:`** Clear criteria that define when the feature is complete and working correctly.

**Working on a Feature:**

- When you start working on a feature, change its status to `IN PROGRESS`.
- Work on features in the `Active` sections in order of priority (from top to bottom).
- When implementing a feature, adhere to the project's coding standards and architecture.
- Ensure that your implementation includes appropriate tests and documentation.
- If during implementation you discover related features or improvements, add them to the appropriate section.

**Updating the File:**

- When a feature is implemented, change its `Status` to `COMPLETED`.

- **Implementation Notes:** deviceService already has downloadRecording method with progress tracking. Need to integrate with UI components and file system APIs for saving files locally using browser download APIs.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Users can select recordings and download them with progress indicators, receive success/error notifications, and files are saved to the browser's download folder.

- **Title:** File Operations - Delete Recordings  
- **Status:** REQUESTED
- **Description:** Allow users to delete recordings directly from the HiDock device with confirmation dialogs and batch operations.
