# Security Analysis Findings for hidock-web-app

This document outlines the security findings from a review of the `hidock-web-app` codebase.

## Findings

### 1. API Key Management

- **Files:** `.env.example`, `README.md`, `src/constants/index.ts`
- **Issue:** The project uses a `.env.example` file to provide a template for environment variables, including `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`. This is a good practice.
- **Risk:** No immediate risk, but it's important to ensure that no `.env` file with a real API key is ever committed to the repository.
- **Recommendation:** Add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of secret keys.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Files:** `src/components/InsightsDisplay.tsx`, `src/components/TranscriptionDisplay.tsx`
- **Issue:** The application renders HTML content directly using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the `InsightsDisplay` and `TranscriptionDisplay` components. This can be a security risk if the content is not properly sanitized.
- **Risk:** If the content from the Gemini API is not properly sanitized, it could lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Recommendation:** Use a library like `dompurify` to sanitize the HTML content before rendering it.

## Positive Security Practices

- The application uses environment variables to manage the API key, which is a good security practice.
- The use of a `.env.example` file is a good way to document the required environment variables.
