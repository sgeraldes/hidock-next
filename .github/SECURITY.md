## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project very seriously. I appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** This would make the vulnerability public and could put users at risk.

Instead, please report any potential vulnerabilities privately through GitHub's built-in security advisory system. This is the most secure way to notify me.

To report a vulnerability:
1. Go to the main page of this repository.
2. Click on the **Security** tab.
3. Click the **Report a vulnerability** button.
4. Fill out the form with the details of the vulnerability.

I will do my best to acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
