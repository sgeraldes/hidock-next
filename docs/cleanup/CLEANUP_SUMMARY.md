# Repository Cleanup Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Created
- ‚úÖ `apps/` - Application directories
- ‚úÖ `research/` - Research and reverse engineering
- ‚úÖ `docs/` - Documentation organization  
- ‚úÖ `config/` - Configuration files
- ‚úÖ `archive/` - Historical items
- ‚úÖ `tests/` - Test directories

### 2. Research Scripts Moved (11 files)
All Python analysis scripts moved from root to appropriate research folders:
- `research/protocol-analysis/`: analyze_auth.py, jensen_protocol_reverse.py
- `research/firmware-analysis/`: decode_firmware.py, firmware_analysis.py, firmware_downloader.py, universal_firmware_downloader.py, test_p1_versions.py, disasm_analysis.py
- `research/command-discovery/`: command_parameter_test.py, command_table_analysis.py, deep_command_analysis.py

### 3. Applications Reorganized
- ‚úÖ **Desktop App**: Moved to `apps/desktop/` (including .venv)
  - Note: Original folder `hidock-desktop-app/` remains with problematic "E:" file
- ‚úÖ **Audio Insights**: Moved to `apps/audio-insights/`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Web App**: Remains at `hidock-web-app/` (locked by process)

### 4. Scripts Updated
- ‚úÖ `scripts/run/run-hidock-desktop.bat` - Updated paths to `apps/desktop`
- ‚úÖ `scripts/run/run-hidock-desktop.sh` - Updated paths to `apps/desktop`
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Web app scripts - Not updated (app couldn't be moved)

### 5. Configuration Files Moved
- ‚úÖ AI configs moved to `config/ai/`
- ‚úÖ VSCode settings moved to `config/ide/vscode/`
- ‚úÖ VSCode settings updated with new paths and cache directories

### 6. Documentation Organized
- ‚úÖ `QUICK_START.md` ‚Üí `docs/getting-started/`
- ‚úÖ Screenshot ‚Üí `docs/assets/screenshots/`
- ‚úÖ Archive reorganized (HAR files, JS files, legacy sites)

### 7. Cleanup Tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache directories (.mypy_cache, .pytest_cache) - Permission denied for deletion
- ‚úÖ .gitignore updated with new paths
- ‚úÖ Temp directories cleaned

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

### 1. Web App Move Failed
**Problem**: `hidock-web-app` folder is locked by a process
**Impact**: Web app remains in original location
**Workaround**: Scripts still work from original location

### 2. Cache Deletion Failed  
**Problem**: Permission denied for .mypy_cache and .pytest_cache
**Impact**: Cache directories remain but are in .gitignore
**Solution**: Will be cleaned on next system restart

### 3. Desktop App Folder Issue
**Problem**: Problematic "E:" file/folder in original location
**Impact**: Original `hidock-desktop-app/` folder remains with just this file
**Note**: All other contents successfully moved to `apps/desktop/`

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [root files]           ‚úÖ Only essential files remain
```

## üîß Manual Actions Required

1. **Restart System** to unlock web app folder, then:
   ```bash
   mv hidock-web-app apps/web
   # Update scripts/run/run-hidock-web.bat line 9 & 18
   # Update scripts/run/run-hidock-web.sh accordingly
   ```

2. **Delete Cache Directories** after restart:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .mypy_cache .pytest_cache
   ```

3. **Remove Old Desktop Folder** (after verifying everything works):
   ```bash
   # This contains only the problematic "E:" file
   # May require chkdsk or special tools
   ```

4. **Update VSCode** to use new settings location:
   - Create symlink: `.vscode -> config/ide/vscode`
   - Or update VSCode to look in new location

## ‚úÖ Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Desktop app scripts updated and ready
- ‚úÖ VSCode settings updated for new paths
- ‚úÖ .gitignore updated
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Full testing pending (need to run scripts)

## üìù Next Steps

1. Test `run-desktop.bat` to verify it works
2. After restart, move web app and update its scripts
3. Run full test suite from new locations
4. Commit changes to git
5. Update any CI/CD pipelines with new paths

## Summary

The cleanup was **mostly successful** with the main goal achieved:
- Root directory is now clean of Python scripts
- Applications are organized (except web app)
- Research tools are properly categorized
- Documentation is better organized
- Configuration is centralized

The remaining issues (web app location, cache deletion) are minor and can be resolved after a system restart.
