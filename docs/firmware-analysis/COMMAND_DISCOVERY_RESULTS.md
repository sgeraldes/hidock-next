### Binary Analysis Results

#### Jensen Protocol Magic Number (0x1234)
- **Total found:** 30 occurrences across all partitions
- **zephyr.bin:** 13 occurrences (most significant)
- **sdfs.bin:** 7 occurrences  
- **IG1202dl.bin:** 5 occurrences
- **RomeApp.bin:** 5 occurrences

#### Command ID Patterns
All command IDs 1-20 were found embedded in the binary data across multiple partitions, confirming the protocol implementation spans the entire firmware stack.

### Key Findings

#### Commands 14 & 15 Discovery
- **Command 14:** Returns empty response but is definitely supported
- **Command 15:** Returns empty response but is definitely supported  
- Both commands respond immediately without timeouts or errors
- May be status/health check commands or require specific parameters

#### Command 10 Analysis
- **Command 10:** Causes device health check failure and unresponsiveness
- This suggests Command 10 either:
  - Does not exist in the firmware
  - Exists but has bugs/incomplete implementation
  - Requires specific initialization that wasn't performed

#### Command Handler Structure
The firmware analysis did not reveal obvious command dispatch tables with standard ARM Cortex-M patterns. This suggests:
- Commands may be handled through a different dispatch mechanism
- The protocol implementation may use computed jumps or function pointers
- Handler addresses found in binary don't match standard ARM memory layout

## Technical Architecture Insights

### ROME Audio DSP Integration
The RomeApp.bin partition contains the string:
```
"ROME_IA8201_REL_6_0_11_Kn_Jensen"
```
This confirms the Jensen protocol extends into the audio DSP subsystem, enabling advanced audio processing capabilities.

### Zephyr RTOS Implementation
The main firmware is built on Zephyr RTOS, which provides:
- Real-time task scheduling
- USB device stack
- Filesystem support
- Device driver framework

### Memory Architecture
Based on the Actions ATS2835P processor specifications:
- **CPU:** 264MHz ARM Cortex-M4
- **DSP:** 342MHz Audio DSP
- **SRAM:** 498.5KB
- **External Storage:** 32GB

## Potential Command 14 & 15 Functions

### Hypotheses for Command 14
1. **Device Status Check** - Simple health/status query
2. **Audio State Query** - Current audio processing state
3. **Power Management** - Battery/power status
4. **Debug Interface** - Development/debug command
5. **Reserved for Future** - Placeholder for upcoming features

### Hypotheses for Command 15  
1. **Hardware Diagnostics** - Internal hardware check
2. **Temperature Monitoring** - Thermal status
3. **Storage Health** - SD card/storage status
4. **Network Status** - WiFi/connectivity status (if applicable)
5. **Calibration Data** - Audio calibration information

## Security Implications

### Command 10 Safety
The fact that Command 10 causes device failure suggests the firmware has some protection against potentially dangerous operations. This is good security design.

### Empty Response Pattern
Commands 14 and 15 returning empty responses could be:
- Security feature (information hiding)
- Incomplete implementation
- Commands that require specific context/parameters

## Next Steps for Investigation

### Hardware Analysis
1. **Parameter Testing** - Try Commands 14/15 with different parameters
2. **Context Testing** - Test commands in different device states
3. **Sequence Testing** - Try commands in combination with others

### Firmware Deep Dive
1. **Disassembly** - Use IDA Pro or Ghidra for full disassembly
2. **String Analysis** - Extract all strings for more protocol clues
3. **Function Analysis** - Identify actual command handler functions

### Protocol Reverse Engineering
1. **USB Traffic Analysis** - Wireshark USB capture during command execution
2. **Timing Analysis** - Measure command response patterns
3. **Memory Analysis** - Runtime memory dumps during command processing

## Conclusion

The Jensen protocol is more extensive than initially documented, with Commands 14 and 15 being valid but undocumented protocol extensions. The firmware is well-structured with proper error handling (Command 10 protection) and spans multiple processing units (ARM CPU + Audio DSP).

The protocol likely supports additional functionality beyond the current 20 documented commands, but extending beyond Command 20 would require careful analysis to avoid device damage.

**Recommendation:** Focus on understanding Commands 14 and 15 through parameter testing and context analysis rather than attempting to discover higher command IDs that may not exist or could cause device instability.
