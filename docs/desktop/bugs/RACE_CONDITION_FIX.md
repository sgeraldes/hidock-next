# Race Condition Fix for HiDock Device Tests

## Problem Description

The HiDock device tests were experiencing race conditions when run as a bundle, causing intermittent failures. Tests would pass when run individually but fail when executed together due to:

1. **Concurrent USB Device Access**: Multiple tests trying to access the same USB device simultaneously
2. **Incomplete Device Cleanup**: Tests not properly cleaning up device state between runs
3. **Async/Sync Coordination Issues**: Poor coordination between async operations and synchronous USB operations
4. **Insufficient Delays**: Not allowing enough time for device state transitions

## Root Causes

### 1. USB Device State Management

- USB devices can get stuck in inconsistent states after communication errors
- Multiple tests accessing the device without proper serialization
- Device reset operations not being properly coordinated

### 2. Threading and Async Issues

- Mix of synchronous USB operations and asynchronous test functions
- No proper locking mechanism for device access across async operations
- Race conditions between device connection/disconnection operations

### 3. Test Isolation Problems

- Tests not properly isolated from each other
- Shared device state bleeding between tests
- Insufficient cleanup between test runs

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Device Test Manager (`test_race_condition_fix.py`)

Created a comprehensive device test manager that provides:

```python
class DeviceTestManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._async_lock = asyncio.Lock()

    @contextmanager
    def exclusive_device_access(self, test_name: str):
        """Synchronous exclusive access"""

    @asynccontextmanager
    async def exclusive_async_device_access(self, test_name: str):
        """Asynchronous exclusive access"""
```

**Key Features:**

- **Exclusive Access**: Only one test can access the device at a time
- **Async Support**: Proper async locking for async test functions
- **Cleanup Delays**: Automatic delays between tests to ensure device state reset
- **Logging**: Clear logging of test execution for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Device Cleanup

```python
def ensure_device_disconnected(device_instance):
    """Ensure device is properly disconnected and cleaned up."""
    if device_instance and hasattr(device_instance, 'disconnect'):
        try:
            device_instance.disconnect()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning during disconnect: {e}")

    if device_instance and hasattr(device_instance, 'reset_device_state'):
        try:
            device_instance.reset_device_state()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning during reset: {e}")
```

**Benefits:**

- **Robust Cleanup**: Handles exceptions during cleanup gracefully
- **State Reset**: Ensures device state is properly reset
- **Error Tolerance**: Continues cleanup even if some operations fail

### 3. Test Modifications

Updated failing tests to use the race condition fix:

```python
@pytest.mark.device
async def test_connection_recovery_after_error():
    async with device_test_manager.exclusive_async_device_access("test_name"):
        # Test implementation with proper delays
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Allow connection to stabilize
        # ... test logic ...
        ensure_device_disconnected(device)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Cleanup delay
```

**Improvements:**

- **Exclusive Access**: Each test gets exclusive device access
- **Proper Delays**: Strategic delays to allow device state transitions
- **Enhanced Cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup in finally blocks
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling and recovery

### 4. Pytest Integration

Enhanced `conftest.py` with device test isolation:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def device_test_isolation(request):
    """Fixture to ensure device tests don't interfere with each other."""
    if request.node.get_closest_marker("device"):
        with _DEVICE_TEST_LOCK:
            yield
            time.sleep(0.2)  # Delay between device tests
    else:
        yield
```

## Usage

### For New Device Tests

```python
import pytest
from .test_race_condition_fix import device_test_manager, ensure_device_disconnected

@pytest.mark.device
async def test_my_device_function():
    async with device_test_manager.exclusive_async_device_access("test_my_device_function"):
        # Your test implementation
        device = create_device()
        try:
            # Test logic here
            await asyncio.sleep(0.3)  # Allow operations to complete
        finally:
            ensure_device_disconnected(device)
            await asyncio.sleep(0.2)  # Cleanup delay
```

### For Synchronous Tests

```python
@pytest.mark.device
def test_my_sync_device_function():
    with device_test_manager.exclusive_device_access("test_my_sync_device_function"):
        # Your test implementation
        device = create_device()
        try:
            # Test logic here
            time.sleep(0.3)  # Allow operations to complete
        finally:
            ensure_device_disconnected(device)
            time.sleep(0.2)  # Cleanup delay
```

## Testing the Fix

### Verification Tests

Run the verification tests to ensure the fix works:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_race_condition_verification.py -v
```

### Race Condition Test Runner

Use the test runner to verify problematic tests now pass consistently:

```bash
python test_race_condition_runner.py
```

### Individual Test Verification

Run previously failing tests multiple times:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_connection_recovery_integration.py -v --count=5
```
