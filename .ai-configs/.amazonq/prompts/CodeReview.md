# Code Review

Apply a code review of all staged files. Do not make any changes; report your review results at the end. Respect the following rules for your review:

- Code is commented in hard-to-understand areas
- Corresponding changes to the documentation have been made
- Run the linter to prove the changes generate no new lint errors
- Run unit tests to prove the change does not introduce breaking changes
- Check if any dependent changes have been merged
