# HiDock Next - Active Context

## Current Focus: Disconnected Mode Implementation Complete

### Recent Session Summary
**Primary Issues Addressed**:
1. **Settings Persistence Bug**: Critical issue where application settings weren't saving/loading properly
2. **USB Connection Reliability**: Device getting stuck requiring physical disconnect/reconnect
3. **Disconnected Mode Feature**: Complete offline functionality implementation
4. **Bug Fixes**: Fixed NameError crash and startup button state issues

### Key Accomplishments

#### Settings Persistence Fix
- **Root Cause**: Key mapping inconsistencies in `settings_window.py`
- **Solution**: Fixed variable name to config key mappings
- **Impact**: All settings now persist correctly (sorting, quit confirmation, debug level, recording interval)
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite `test_specific_settings_fix.py`

#### USB Device Reset Implementation
- **Root Cause**: USB communication errors leaving device in inconsistent state
- **Solution**: Implemented `reset_device_state()` method with automatic retry logic
- **Impact**: Eliminates need for physical disconnect/reconnect cycle
- **Testing**: Added integration tests for connection recovery scenarios

#### Disconnected Mode Implementation
- **Root Cause**: Users needed ability to view cached files and play downloaded content when device not connected
- **Solution**: Created `OfflineModeManager` class and integrated offline functionality throughout GUI
- **Impact**: Complete offline experience with cached file display and downloaded file playback
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit and integration tests for offline scenarios

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **NameError Fix**: Resolved crash when clicking files in disconnected mode (`is_connected` variable not defined)
- **Startup Button States**: Fixed Connect button showing blue instead of orange on startup when disconnected
- **Visual Indicators**: Added proper disconnected state indicators throughout the interface

### Completed Work: Disconnected Mode Feature

#### Offline Functionality Implementation
- **Goal**: Enable users to view cached files and play downloaded content when device is not connected
- **Components**:
  - `OfflineModeManager` class for cached file operations
  - GUI integration for offline state management
  - Visual indicators for disconnected state
  - Proper button state management when offline

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **NameError Resolution**: Fixed crash when clicking files in disconnected mode
- **Startup State Fix**: Corrected Connect button color on startup (orange when disconnected)
- **Visual Consistency**: Added disconnected indicator and proper button states

#### Documentation Enhancement Complete
- **Change Registry**: Comprehensive tracking of all modifications
- **Project Intelligence**: Complete structured documentation for AI assistant continuity
- **Test Coverage**: All features have comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Recently Completed: Enhanced File Operations

**üóÇÔ∏è Improved Delete Operations:**
- **Separate Delete Options**: Added "Delete from Device" vs "Delete Local Copy" with clear confirmation dialogs
- **User Confirmation**: Proper confirmation dialogs explaining the action and consequences
- **Smart Context Menus**: Options appear based on file status and device connection state

**üìÇ Open Locally Feature:**
- **Cross-platform Support**: Opens downloaded files in system default application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files with user-friendly messages
- **Context Integration**: Added to right-click context menu for downloaded files

**üß™ Test Organization Improvements:**
- **Proper Test Separation**: Created `test_file_operations_gui.py` for GUI file operations
- **Logical Grouping**: Tests now organized by functionality rather than chronological addition
- **Updated Documentation**: Enhanced `testingPatterns.md` with clear organization guidelines

### Known Limitations
1. **Local-Only Files**: Files that exist only locally (not on device) don't appear in the file list
2. **File Discovery**: Application primarily shows device files; local-only files are not discovered

### Next Steps
1. **Local File Discovery**: Consider adding option to show local-only files in the list
2. **Feature Testing**: Validate new delete and open functionality in real-world scenarios
3. **User Experience**: Gather feedback on the improved file operations
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor cached file loading performance

### Technical Context
