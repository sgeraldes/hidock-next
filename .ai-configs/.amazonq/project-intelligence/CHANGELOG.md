## 2025-01-02 - Offline Audio Functionality Implementation

### Requirements Implemented
- **Get Insights**: Works when audio file is downloaded locally, regardless of device connection status
- **Play Audio (Downloaded)**: Works when audio file is downloaded locally, regardless of device connection status  
- **Play Audio (On Device, Connected)**: When device is connected, can play non-downloaded files (downloads first, then plays)
- **Cannot Play**: Non-downloaded files when device is disconnected (can't download)

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `_update_menu_states()` method in `gui_main_window.py` (lines 1168-1175)
```python
# Get Insights should work offline for downloaded files
can_get_insights = (has_selection and num_selected == 1 and 
                  not self.is_long_operation_active and not self.is_audio_playing)
if can_get_insights and not is_connected:
    # When not connected, only allow insights for downloaded files
    file_iid = self.file_tree.selection()[0]
    local_path = self._get_local_filepath(file_iid)
    can_get_insights = os.path.exists(local_path)

self.actions_menu.entryconfig(
    "Get Insights",
    state="normal" if can_get_insights else "disabled",
)
```

#### 2. Enhanced `play_selected_audio_gui()` method (lines 2883-2900)
```python
# Check if device is connected for download
is_connected = self.device_manager.device_interface.is_connected()
if is_connected:
    self._download_for_playback_and_play(filename, local_filepath)
else:
    messagebox.showinfo(
        "File Not Available", 
        f"'{filename}' is not downloaded and device is disconnected.\n\n"
        "Please connect the device to download the file, or select a downloaded file.",
        parent=self
    )
```

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_offline_audio_requirements.py`
- 6 tests covering all offline audio functionality requirements
- All tests pass, confirming implementation works correctly

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` with offline audio functionality requirements
- Requirements documented in project intelligence system
- Implementation follows TDD principles (Red-Green-Refactor)

### Impact
- Users can now play downloaded audio files when device is disconnected
- Users can get AI insights from downloaded files when device is disconnected
- Clear error messages when trying to access non-downloaded files offline
- Maintains existing functionality for connected device operations

### Files Modified
1. `gui_main_window.py` - Core offline functionality implementation
2. `tests/test_offline_audio_requirements.py` - Test coverage for requirements
3. `.amazonq/project-intelligence/systemPatterns.md` - Requirements documentation
4. `.amazonq/project-intelligence/CHANGELOG.md` - This change log

### Verification
- All 6 offline audio functionality tests pass
- Implementation follows the documented requirements exactly
- Code maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
