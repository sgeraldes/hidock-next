# Command 10 Parameter Discovery Research

**Purpose:** Systematic exploration of Command 10 parameters to unlock hidden functionality  
**Status:** Research phase - isolated from main codebase  
**Risk Level:** LOW - Command 10 has built-in protection mechanisms  

## Overview

Command 10 exists in the firmware but causes controlled device failure when sent with empty parameters. This suggests it requires specific authentication, parameters, or device state to function properly.

## Research Hypothesis

Command 10 is likely one of:
1. **Factory/Manufacturing Command** - Requires specific authentication key
2. **Debug Mode Activation** - Enables development/diagnostic features  
3. **Advanced Configuration** - Device-specific settings not available through other commands
4. **Bootloader Interface** - Preparation for firmware update or recovery
5. **Hardware Test Command** - Built-in hardware diagnostics

## Safety Measures

- All testing isolated in research folder
- Command 10 has demonstrated safe failure mechanism
- Device recovery testing confirmed working
- No modification of main application code
- All tests log results for analysis

## Research Plan

1. **Parameter Structure Analysis** - Test various parameter formats
2. **Authentication Key Discovery** - Try common keys and patterns
3. **Subcommand Exploration** - Test command/subcommand structures
4. **Device State Testing** - Try command in different device states
5. **Timing Analysis** - Test command timing and sequencing

## Files in This Research

- `command_10_systematic_discovery.py` - Main discovery script
- `parameter_generators.py` - Generate test parameter combinations  
- `safe_testing_framework.py` - Safe testing with recovery
- `results_analyzer.py` - Analysis of test results
- `discovery_log.txt` - Complete test results log

## Usage

This research is **completely isolated** from the main HiDock applications. Run only for research purposes with understanding that Command 10 behavior is unknown.
