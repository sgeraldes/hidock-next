Test for offline audio functionality requirements.

Requirements:
1. Get Insights: Works when audio file is downloaded locally, regardless of device connection
2. Play Audio: Works when audio file is downloaded locally, regardless of device connection
3. Cannot play: Non-downloaded files when device is disconnected
4. Can play: Downloaded files even when device is disconnected

Following TDD: Red -> Green -> Refactor
