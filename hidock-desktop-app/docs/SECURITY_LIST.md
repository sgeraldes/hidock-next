# Security Analysis Findings for hidock-desktop-app

This document outlines the security findings from a review of the `hidock-desktop-app` codebase.

## Findings

### 1. Hardcoded (Commented) API Key

- **File:** `transcription_module.py`
- **Line:** 11
- **Issue:** A commented-out line of code contains a placeholder for a Gemini API key: `# API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"`.
- **Risk:** While not an active key, this is a dangerous practice. Developers might accidentally uncomment this line and commit a real key. It also encourages poor security habits.
- **Recommendation:** Remove this line entirely. API keys should be managed exclusively through environment variables or a secure configuration file, as is already being done elsewhere in the code.

### 2. Use of `eval()`

- **File:** `hidock.js`
- **Issue:** The `hidock.js` file contains the use of `eval()`, which can be a security risk if used with untrusted input.
- **Risk:** The use of `eval()` can lead to arbitrary code execution if the input is not properly sanitized.
- **Recommendation:** Review the use of `eval()` and replace it with a safer alternative if possible.

## Positive Security Practices

- The application correctly uses environment variables (`os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")`) to load the API key, which is a good security practice.
