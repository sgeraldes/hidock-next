# Product Guidelines: HiDock Next Knowledge System

## Design Philosophy
- **Knowledge-First:** The UI should prioritize content and insights over file management mechanics.
- **Context-Aware:** Information should be presented in context (e.g., meeting details with transcripts, people with their related conversations).
- **Clean & Modern:** Use a clean, distraction-free interface that allows the user to focus on the content (transcripts, summaries, insights).
- **Consistent Navigation:** Maintain a clear and predictable navigation structure (Library, Assistant, Explore, People, Projects, Actionables).

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Helpful:** The application should sound like a competent, unobtrusive assistant.
- **Concise:** Avoid unnecessary jargon or verbose explanations. Get straight to the point.
- **Empowering:** Focus on what the user can *do* with their knowledge (e.g., "Generate Report", "Find Connections").

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:** Use a neutral background with clear accent colors for actions and status indicators.
    - *Actionables:* Use distinct colors to indicate urgency (e.g., Red for immediate attention, Yellow for pending).
    - *Status:* Use standard conventions (Green for complete, Grey for pending).
- **Typography:** Use legible, sans-serif fonts for optimal readability of long-form text (transcripts).
- **Iconography:** Use consistent, recognizable icons (e.g., Lucide React icons) to aid navigation and identification.

## User Interaction Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show the most important information first, and allow users to drill down for more details (e.g., expandable transcript sections).
- **Contextual Actions:** Action buttons should be relevant to the current view (e.g., "Ask Assistant" when viewing a transcript).
- **Seamless Transitions:** Animations should be subtle and serve to guide the user's attention.
