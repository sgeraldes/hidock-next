# Product Guide: HiDock Next Knowledge System

## Initial Concept
HiDock Next is transforming from a device management utility into a comprehensive Knowledge System. The core vision is to turn ephemeral conversations into permanent, searchable, and actionable knowledge. The application will serve two distinct modes: Device Management (legacy sync) and the new Knowledge System (capture, organize, explore).

## Target Audience
- **Professionals:** For meeting minutes, decision tracking, and task management.
- **Researchers/Students:** For organizing interview transcripts and study notes.
- **Power Users:** For advanced audio management and knowledge discovery.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Permanence:** Conversations are no longer lost; they become a permanent part of the user's knowledge base.
- **Actionability:** AI-driven insights turn recordings into actionable items like tasks, summaries, and decisions.
- **Connection:** The system discovers relationships between people, projects, and distinct knowledge captures.

## Key Features
- **Library (formerly Recordings):** A repository for all captured knowledge, organized by source, quality, and status.
- **Assistant (formerly Chat):** A knowledge-powered AI companion for querying the knowledge base and generating artifacts.
- **Explore (formerly Search):** A discovery engine to find connections and patterns across the knowledge base.
- **People & Projects:** Auto-populating entities that organize knowledge around the "who" and "what".
- **Actionables:** A proactive center for suggestions and artifact generation (minutes, reports).
- **Device Sync:** Robust management for HiDock hardware.

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Integration:** The transition between device management and knowledge exploration should be fluid.
- **Proactive Intelligence:** The system should offer insights and actions before the user explicitly asks for them.
- **Trust & Clarity:** AI-generated content must be transparent, with clear attribution to source audio.
